<!--  Thanks for submitting an issue!
Before submit, please be aware of below things:

* kubecolor is still being actively developed. Your issue might be fixed in the latest version kubecolor. Before submitting the issue, run `$ go get -u github.com/dty1er/kubecolor/cmd/kubecolor` to update kubecolor and make sure the issue can be reproduced even if you are using the latest one.

* Because kubecolor internally calls kubectl command, kubectl whose version is unsupported is unsupported by kubecolor as well. Make sure your kubectl is officially supported version. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/

* If you think the output of kubecolor is strange, please give us following information:
  - Screenshot of "kubectl" output
  - Screenshot of "kubecolor" output
  - What's the issue and what you expect
  - Shell info (bash/zsh/fish etc, its version)
